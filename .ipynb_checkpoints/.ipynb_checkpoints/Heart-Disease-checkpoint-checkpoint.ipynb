    "The Heart-Disease-Dataset database consists of 76 attributes, but only a subset of 14 attributes has been utilized in all published experiments thus far. Among these experiments, ML researchers have exclusively employed the Cleveland database. The attribute labeled \"goal\" indicates the presence of heart disease in a patient and is represented by an integer ranging from 0 (indicating no presence) to 4. Previous studies conducted using the Cleveland database have primarily focused on distinguishing between the presence (values 1, 2, 3, 4) and absence (value 0) of heart disease.\n",
